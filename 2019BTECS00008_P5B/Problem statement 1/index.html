                History books will remember <b>Neeraj Chopra </b> as the first Indian track
                and field athlete to clinch a gold medal at the Olympics in Tokyo 2020. His effort also helped him
                become only the second Indian after <b>Abhinav Bindra</b> to clinch a top podium finish at Olympics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chopra, significantly, was only 23 when he created history in Tokyo. His best effort of 87.58m not only
                helped him rise atop the podium but also fulfilled the dreams of 1.38 billion Indians and the late
                Milkha Singh who yearned for an athletic medal in Olympics.

            <h3>
                The chubby kid who found discipline as javelin thrower
            </h3>
            <p>
                Chopra was one of the fittest athletes on the track in <b>Tokyo 2020</b>. But he was not quite so when
                he first
                started. It was, in fact, his interest to become a javelin thrower that brought discipline into his
                life.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was a chubby kid in 2011, when his family insisted him to join a gymnasium. Chopra would have to
                travel nearly 20kms away from his village Khandra to visit his gym in Panipat.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was during this time that he came across athletes practicing at the Shivaji stadium and developed
                interest for javelin throw. He had, incidentally, tried out a few other disciplines, including running,
                but he chose to continue with javelin throw once he found out that he is good at it.

            <h3>Start of a glittering career</h3>
            <p>
                He first learnt the art of javelin throw under coach <b>Jaiveer Singh</b> in Panipat. However, in
                pursuit of
                excellence, Chopra shifted his base to Tau Devi Lal Stadium in Panchkula.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was, here, that javelin coach Naseem Ahmad would start his training with long-distance running in the
                morning and followed it up with javelin throw practice later in the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ahmad identified that, unlike other athletes, Chopra was disciplined and serious about his craft and
                spent his free-time in perfecting it from an early age.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>"He’d sit with his notebook and take tips from them (seniors). He would never shy away from training
                    and
                    would always set targets of winning each day’s round with the group,"</b> Ahmad told the Indian
                Express.
            </p>

            <h3>Left a mark at Junior World Championship</h3>
            <p>Chopra had well and truly announced himself in 2016 at <b>IAAF World U20 Championships </b> in Bydgoszcz, Poland.
                It was then that the world took notice of him as he hurled the spear to a distance of 86.48m, setting a
                junior world record, to take home the gold medal.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was after this achievement that he joined the Indian Army as a junior commissioned officer and could help his father, a farmer, financially.
